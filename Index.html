                    <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Esther Sopein but you can call me Teddy. I got into the tech space in 2020 ,when i enrolled for a 6 months tech training in which i registered for web.development because i've always loved creating and building things from scratch.
                then i got to know about developing website from scratxh using codes. It sounds so interesting then i got into it and discovered it's really fun but challenging. I got so intrested in it , developed so many webpages which are saved on github nut i stopped at a point when i had to focus on my academics.
             I'm done with academics for now and i'm back to my tech wolrd, it feels really difficult to pick up from where i stopped because coding is not something to leave for months and just come back to easily like that but i know <strong>CONSISTENSY</strong> will make it easier to get back on track. I'm excited to return to <strong> Front-end web. development</strong>,building clean,user- friendly and responsive websites.
            Walk with me on my journey of getting back on my feet </p>
